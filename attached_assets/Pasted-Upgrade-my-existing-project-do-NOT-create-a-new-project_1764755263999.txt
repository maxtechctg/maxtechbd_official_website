Upgrade my existing project (do NOT create a new project).
Add a full Blog Management Module inside the current admin dashboard.
Follow all instructions below exactly and integrate into the current folder structure.

🔹 1. BLOG ADMIN FORM (inside existing dashboard layout)

Add a new menu item: Blog Manager

Inside the Blog Manager, create a form with the following fields:

• Title (text input)
• Featured Image (file upload, store in existing uploads folder)
• Content (Markdown/HTML editor)
Use Toast UI Editor OR SimpleMDE with toolbar:
H1, H2, Bold, Italic, Link, List, Quote, Code Block, Preview

• Category (dropdown + option to add new category)
• Active / Inactive toggle
• Publish button

The editor must save content as markdown, and also generate HTML version on save.

The blog form must use the existing Bootstrap styling of the product UI.

🔹 2. DATABASE CHANGES

Inside the existing database system, add a new table/collection:

blog_posts:

id

title

slug

category

markdown_content

html_content

featured_image

active (boolean)

published_at

source (“manual” or “auto”)

created_at

updated_at

Add migrations if needed.

🔹 3. ROUTES TO ADD

Add REST endpoints inside existing route structure:

GET    /admin/blog
POST   /admin/blog
PUT    /admin/blog/:id
DELETE /admin/blog/:id
GET    /blog/:slug    (public view page)


Public /blog/:slug must render markdown as HTML.

🔹 4. ADD DAILY AUTO-BLOG GENERATOR (ChatGPT API)

Add a scheduled cron job using the existing backend system:

• Runs once per day
• Generates an SEO-optimized blog post using ChatGPT
• Saves the generated post in the blog table
• Mark as source = "auto"
• Set active = true and publish immediately

Use this API prompt:

You are an expert SEO content writer. Produce one complete blog post in MARKDOWN only.
Include:
- Title (≤ 70 characters)
- Meta description (≤ 160 characters)
- 800–1200 word article with H1, H2, lists, links
- 5 tags
- CTA at the end
Deliver valid markdown only.


Use model:

gpt-4o-mini (configurable by ENV)

Environment variable:

OPENAI_API_KEY

Add error logging if API fails.

🔹 5. ADMIN PANEL FEATURE: AUTO-BLOG HISTORY

Add a simple table inside Blog Manager:

Columns:
• Date
• Status (Success / Failed)
• Generated Title

🔹 6. REQUIREMENTS
