Hi, I want to add an admin dashboard to manage all database content (CRUD) for this project.

Goal:
Build a secure admin dashboard in the existing Next.js + Prisma + PostgreSQL setup so I can manage all tables you see in my database screenshot:

AboutSection

ClientLogo

ContactSubmission

FooterLink

HeroSlide

MenuItem

NewsPost

PageContent

Project

Service

SiteSettings

SocialLink

StatCounter

TeamMember

Testimonial

TimelineMilestone

VisionSection

1. Authentication (very important)

Create only a login page for admin, no signup page.

Admin credentials and info must come from the database (e.g. AdminUser table seeded with one default user).

Use JWT-based authentication:

On successful login, issue a JWT and store it in a secure way (preferably httpOnly cookie).

Protect all dashboard routes so only authenticated admin can access them.

Add logout functionality that clears the token.

2. Admin Dashboard structure

Create a dashboard layout (e.g. /admin) with sidebar/menu links for each module based on the tables above:

/admin/about-section

/admin/hero-slides

/admin/services

/admin/projects

/admin/news-posts

/admin/testimonials

/admin/team-members

/admin/client-logos

/admin/social-links

/admin/footer-links

/admin/site-settings

/admin/stat-counters

/admin/timeline-milestones

/admin/vision-section

/admin/page-content

/admin/contact-submissions (read-only list is enough)

3. CRUD functionality

For each module (except maybe ContactSubmission which can be read-only):

List view: table with pagination/search if possible

Create: form to add a new record

Edit: form to update existing record

Delete: option to remove a record (with confirmation)

All operations should use Prisma and update the existing PostgreSQL tables.

4. UI / Design

Use a simple, clean admin UI (it doesn’t have to match the frontend marketing site, just be clear and usable).

Keep the existing public site unchanged; only add new admin routes and components.

5. Security & structure

Protect all /admin/** routes with the JWT auth middleware/guard.

Make sure API routes for CRUD are also protected (only accessible when logged in as admin).

Please implement this full admin dashboard, hook it up to the current Prisma schema, and let me know how to log in (initial admin email/password and where it’s seeded in the database).
